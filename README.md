# quantum-chess

Hi! Welcome to the QOSI Quantum Chess repo.
This project aims to build a fully functional quantum chessboard, on which two players can play a game. Quantum chess differs from classical chess in that it lends various quantum abilities to its pieces in the form of superposition (as though you are playing on two boards at once!) and entanglement(moving one affects the other!). This offers a twist to the age old game and helps us demonstrate these quantum phenomena.

We will begin by covering the basics of Q#.
Once we are comfortable with the language, we will move on to the main project- building the quantum chessboard. 

Pre-requisites:
1. Linear algebra
2. Complex numbers

It's okay if you aren't very well versed in these topics, we will only need the basics, and we'll brush up on those too.

You can find the rules for quantum chess [here](https://github.com/caphindsight/TrulyQuantumChess/wiki).

You can find a few boards to play [here](https://quantumchess.net/) and [here](https://truly-quantum-chess.sloppy.zone/).
