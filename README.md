# quantum-algorithms

Hi! Welcome to the QOSI Quantum Algorithms repo.

While this is a part of an initiative for open source projects, this project will initially focus more on learning Q#, basic quantum computing concepts and a few quantum algorithms. We will do this primarily using Microsoft's Quantum Katas.

Once we are comfortable with the language, we will move on to the main project- building the CHSH game. While the Katas already have a tutorial for this, we will try to build this on our own, with a few additions. Our aim is to demonstrate that a quantum strategy is better than a classical one in this particular game.

Pre-requisites:
1. Linear algebra
2. Complex numbers

It's okay if you aren't very well versed in these topics, we will only need the basics, and we'll brush up on those too.

Here are some resources you can explore:
